            1. It appears that as the total rides per city increases, the fares per city decreases (on average) based on the ride sharing data scatter plot.  For example, the majority of rural bubbles are much higher on the y-axis (fares per city) compared to the urban bubbles that are all lower.
            2.	Per the first pie chart, suburban cities appear to make about half of the total fares as the urban cities bring in (30.5% total fares vs. 62.7%).
            3.	The last two pie charts show that the urban cities comprise the majority of total drivers (by 4/5â€™s) and also offer the most rides- a little more than double the two other city types combined.  This makes sense based on the supply and demand principle.
